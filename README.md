# bookmarkApp
Simple electron bookmark application.

Credit for design goes to Ray Viljoen.  Minor changes by me, mostly thorough comments that act as notes and references as well as code structure.  I usually will default to long form over short hand ternery operator statements, things like that.

Thanks!
